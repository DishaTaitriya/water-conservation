              <br>
              <span>Benefits:</span>
              These ponds provide a year-round water source for irrigation, even during the dry months.
               Farmers can access stored rainwater, reducing dependence on erratic rainfall and external water supplies.
               Water conservation ponds also help replenish groundwater levels, promoting sustainable water use.

              <strong>Agroforestry</strong>
              <br>
              <span>Description:</span>
               In the Northeastern states, agroforestry is the practice of planting trees alongside crops, creating a multi-layered farming system that mimics a natural ecosystem. This method promotes biodiversity, improves soil health, and helps conserve water.
              <br>
              <span>Benefits:</span>
               Trees help retain soil moisture, reducing the need for frequent irrigation and improving water availability for crops.
               Agroforestry systems prevent soil erosion in hilly areas, maintaining soil fertility and reducing land degradation.
              In addition to crop yields, trees provide farmers with timber, fruits, and other products, diversifying income sources and improving resilience.
